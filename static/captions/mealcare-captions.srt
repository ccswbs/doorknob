1
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:07,303
- Change happens at a community level.

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,080
Small people put in small efforts

3
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,263
and those efforts add up to something big.

4
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:15,740
I knew it was going to be a challenge

5
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:17,450
to set something up like this,

6
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:21,620
but sometimes it is the
nitty-gritty, tiny little details

7
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:23,023
that are going to make the difference.

8
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:24,580
(somber music)

9
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:27,060
I was in Creelman in first year

10
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,570
and I just kind of asked out of curiosity.

11
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:32,310
I was like, "Are the
leftovers kind of repurposed

12
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:33,647
or are they donated?"

13
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,130
- We had been donating food at that time

14
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:39,350
on a relatively small scale.

15
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:43,780
Operations in commercial
kitchens and Public Health rules

16
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:47,098
don't make donating food very easy.

17
00:00:47,098 --> 00:00:49,681
(somber music)

18
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:02,810
- It's very easy for people to say, "No."

19
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:04,730
It's not just, "You're in MealCare. Great.

20
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:05,563
We divert food.

21
00:01:05,563 --> 00:01:07,220
It's so fun. It's so easy."

22
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:09,410
There are some people that maybe

23
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:11,110
don't think it's going to work initially,

24
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:14,300
or sometimes there are
just logistical challenge.

25
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:15,700
- Often we do have to hear, "No,"

26
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:18,410
and it's not really because certain donors

27
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:19,490
don't want to work with us.

28
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:21,700
It's just because there
are a lot of details

29
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:22,800
that we need to work out.

30
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,400
And for that reason,
we do hear, "No," a lot

31
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,410
but we continue to persevere

32
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:30,480
until we can make some
kind of partnership.

33
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,230
- [Interviewer] So who said, "Yes"?

34
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:38,040
- Well, one of our first big
yeses was from Chef Vijay,

35
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,790
and he was one of our
really great supporters.

36
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:45,747
- When Kiana and David approached
us with the MealCare idea,

37
00:01:45,747 --> 00:01:47,660
it was a no-brainer for us.

38
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:50,270
The plan and the enthusiasm

39
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:52,800
that Kiana and David came up with

40
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,270
was something that we had not seen before.

41
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:59,230
- [David] After our first
yes, we were able to continue

42
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:01,990
to foster that relationship
and put ourselves

43
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:04,553
in a position where we
could expand our impact.

44
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:07,490
- The very first time that
I heard about MealCare

45
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:09,070
was actually in this room.

46
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:12,690
David and Kiana went up to the
front of the entire lecture,

47
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:14,530
which was over 400 students,

48
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:18,110
and gave the most inspiring
speech that I've ever heard

49
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:21,932
about how passionate they are
to reduce student security.

50
00:02:21,932 --> 00:02:24,960
(gentle music)

51
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,260
- Guelph is a food school.

52
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:28,410
There's such a focus
on sustainability here.

53
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:31,520
And so that's why I really
feel like MealCare just fits.

54
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,610
- It is the younger
generation who have solutions

55
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:36,700
for many of the problems today.

56
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:41,280
And the university has to
support them to succeed.

57
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,460
- We're so grateful.

58
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:44,210
We've had so much help along the way.

59
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:45,870
And our team of volunteers

60
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:48,150
has really made the world of difference.

61
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:51,770
- Without them, we wouldn't
have actually been able to grow

62
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:52,880
to actually be in a position

63
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,516
where we could impact more change.

64
00:02:55,516 --> 00:02:56,960
- [Students] Hi.
- [Woman] Hi.

65
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,883
- [Kiana] How are you?

66
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:02,300
Whenever I do a donation for MealCare,

67
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,320
it just makes me feel empowered.

68
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,830
Something about seeing the physical food

69
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:09,610
being taken off of the car

70
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:13,310
and put somewhere where you
know that it's going to be used,

71
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:15,900
it's really, I think it's really cool.

72
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,670
Yeah, it's a really special feeling.

73
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:18,810
- I'm originally from India

74
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:23,390
and I've seen, firsthand, the
poverty and food insecurity

75
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:25,770
that affects millions of people.

76
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:28,150
Canada is one of the wealthiest
countries in the world

77
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:31,080
and stats have, time and again, shown

78
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:35,270
that we waste 1/3 of all
the food that is produced.

79
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:39,180
So it falls upon all of us,
personally and professionally,

80
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:42,600
to take ownership of this problem,

81
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,393
which really can be solved.

82
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,190
- Different groupings of food.

83
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:52,040
We have beverages, we have
fresh foods we have...

84
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,150
In the homeless population,

85
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:57,860
there's also a deficit in terms of feeling

86
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,380
that they're cared for.

87
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,580
In official discussion
about homeless people,

88
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,960
we're talking about people
with no fixed address, right?

89
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,800
And a fixed address is not actually

90
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,130
going to solve that problem.

91
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:12,130
It's really important for people
that are living insecurely,

92
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:14,780
that they have a sense of home

93
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:17,190
and home begins when there's community

94
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,570
and when there's caring.

95
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:21,550
The MealCare meals, as
they started coming in,

96
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:23,320
we couldn't believe the quality.

97
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:27,210
When people know that they're
going to be able to get

98
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:30,670
not just any food but
really good quality food,

99
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:32,290
nice variety,

100
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:35,630
yeah, it just tells you
that you're worth something,

101
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:36,623
you're worthwhile.

102
00:04:36,623 --> 00:04:38,400
(gentle music)

103
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,200
- Food security, if you think
of the actual definition

104
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,830
is like, safe, affordable, accessible,

105
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:45,020
culturally appropriate,

106
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:47,660
and just some of the things
we're able to donate,

107
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:50,730
like we have vegetarian
options and gluten free,

108
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:53,070
and a lot of our meals are halal.

109
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:55,120
- It's not food waste or leftover,

110
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,620
it's good food, nutritious food

111
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:00,500
that can really make a
difference in someone's life.

112
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,430
Since our inception at MealCare Guelph,

113
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:08,430
we have donated 14,163 pounds of food.

114
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,080
- Wow, that's impressive.

115
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,430
- Go to your calculator.

116
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:14,265
Let's see.

117
00:05:14,265 --> 00:05:19,140
14,000 pounds divided by 365:

118
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:22,549
38.35.

119
00:05:22,549 --> 00:05:26,120
38 and 1/3 years of free lunches,

120
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,040
if your lunch weighs one pound.

121
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,020
That's so much food.

122
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,221
I think it's really cool.

123
00:05:31,221 --> 00:05:34,630
The very first donation Dave and I did

124
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:35,960
was just the two of us,

125
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,740
wheeling a little wheelbarrow
of food in the freezing cold.

126
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,170
- For our first couple of donations,

127
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:43,640
it wasn't a lot of food, right?

128
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,690
But when you put it into perspective,

129
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:47,870
even a couple of pounds,
that can feed so many people

130
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:49,640
who can really depend on it.

131
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,590
And it was just such an amazing feeling.

132
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:53,570
- I feel like I'm really
making a difference

133
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:54,820
in someone's life.

134
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,650
And it just makes me feel proud to be

135
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:58,340
a University of Guelph student.

136
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:59,870
- Even though it seems like food waste

137
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:01,970
is a very daunting global issue,

138
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:05,500
small, proactive, continued change

139
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,770
is really going to make a
difference in the long run.

140
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:10,740
It is challenging and it's
never going to be easy

141
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:13,150
but the reward is so worth it

142
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:16,160
if you're willing to really
fight for our message

143
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,310
and what we believe in.

144
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:19,893
(gentle music)
