      <p>Important things to remember:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Estimated cut-off ranges are based on the admission averages from previous
          years and are provided solely as a point of reference. Exact cut-offs for the
          current cycle will be determined by the quantity and quality of applications
          received and the number of places available in the program. Co-op averages
          will often exceed the estimated cut-off ranges. Students not admissible to
          co-op will be automatically considered for the regular program
        </li>
        <li>
          The University of Guelph will treat courses previously completed through Summer School, Night School, 
          or Correspondence in the same manner as those completed through day school. They will be considered equally in 
          determining your admission average. The University of Guelph will use the highest grade reported for any 
          repeated courses.
        </li>
        <li>The single asterisk * indicates that the program is offered with and without co-op.</li>
        <li>The double asterisk ** indicates that the program has a mandatory co-op.</li>
